# Spring TO-DO Web Application
A To-Do manager with Spring and SQLite. I am trying to make it as much as possible complete, as an industry product, at the same time, a project to learn stuff.

### Inspirations:
This project is a combination of the features in Github and Wordpress that I could merge into one single project.
- Todo management & sociality (Github)
- Content management (Wordpress)

### Features:
- Login / Sign up (multi-user)
- Todo management
- User profile
- Administrator dashboard
